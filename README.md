# Description
A card game implementation in VB.NET that uses file handling, array manipulation and shuffling algorithms.

The game consists of a player's hand and five decks of cards: a left pile, a right pile, and three centre piles. The objective of the game is to empty the player's hand by playing cards on the centre piles. The cards can be placed on the centre piles either by matching their suit or value.

The game features a shuffle sound effect and a timer. At the end of the game, the player's time is recorded and their name and time are saved in a file.
